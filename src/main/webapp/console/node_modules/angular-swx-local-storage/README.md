# angular-swx-local-storage

[![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/angular-swx-local-storage.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/angular-swx-local-storage) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scriptwerx/angular-swx-local-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scriptwerx/angular-swx-local-storage) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/scriptwerx/angular-swx-local-storage/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/scriptwerx/angular-swx-local-storage)

$localStorage service for use in your AngularJS applications.

Provides a key-value (string-object) storage, that is backed by localStorage with support for expiry (in days).

Objects put or retrieved from this storage are automatically serialized or deserialized by angular's toJson/fromJson.

## Installation

Node Package Manager:

    npm install --save-dev angular-swx-local-storage

Bower, but please see: [Why we should stop using Bower - and how to do it](https://gofore.com/ohjelmistokehitys/stop-using-bower/).

    bower install angular-swx-local-storage

## Usage

Simply add the angular-swx-local-storage assets to your project and include them in your HTML or as part of your build process.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="angular-swx-local-storage.min.js"></script>

angular-swx-local-storage.js should appear after angular.js is included.
Prefer minified assets (.min) for production.

    myApp.$inject = ['$localStorage'];
    function myApp($localStorage) {
        // Your app code...
    }

    angular
        .module('myApp', ['swxLocalStorage']);

## Dependencies

angular-swx-local-storage depends on angular.js, and is tested on version 1.3.14.

## Supported Browsers

angular-swx-local-storage will function correctly within all browsers that support [Web Storage][].

For browsers with Web Storage disabled or in private browsing mode; a simple session Object fallback is used - **please be aware of the limitations in this scenario**.

# Contributing
If one of the existing models doesn't meet your needs, fork the project, implement the model and an example using it, send us a pull request, for consideration for inclusion in the project.

A few rules for pull requests

* Please commit to the development branch
* All new features must come with unit test coverage
* Bug fixes should come with unit tests that prove their fix
* Everything should include [ngdoc][] code comments.

## Builds

First clone the repository and checkout the "development" branch
make sure nodejs is installed via your system's package manager.
Install [gulp.js][]: npm install -g gulp
have node download it's required modules with: npm install

Once completed; there are a number of build options available; each build process will automatically check and install dependencies through [bower][].

### Developemnt build
To generate a development build:

    gulp

This will run all tests and generate a development build; the build version will be updated v0.0.1 becomes v0.0.1-0.

### Patch build
To generate a patch build:

    gulp patch

This will run all tests and generate a patch build; the patch version will be updated v0.0.1-0 becomes v0.0.2.

### Minor release build
To generate a minor release build:

    gulp build

This will run all tests and generate a minor release build; the minor version will be updated v0.0.2 becomes v0.1.0.

### Major release build
To generate a major release build:

    gulp release

This will run all tests and generate a major release build; the major version will be updated v0.1.0 becomes v1.0.0.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated from [ngdoc][] code comments within the JavaScript source.

This documentation can be found within the **'./docs/'** folder.

## Tips for Testing

Unit tests are written in Jasmine.

In order to run tests without generating a build use:

    gulp test:js

If you have NOT yet generated a build (as detailed above); the [bower][] packages may not be installed and tests will fail as a result of this.

In order to install the dependencies use the following and then re-run your tests.

    bower install

Scriptwerx now uses Travis CI for continuous integration. Visit our travis build page [here](https://travis-ci.org/scriptwerx) to see the latest status.

## Development &amp; Issue Tracking

We use [JIRA][] to capture and organize issues, assign work, and follow team activity.
